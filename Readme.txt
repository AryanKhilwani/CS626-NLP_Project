"""Script based on the BERT finetuning runner, modified for performing emotion prediction.

Main changes:
- Updated DataProcessor
- Included multilabel classification
- Included various evaluation metrics
- Included evaluation as part of training
- Included sentiment-based regularization (manually defined)
- Included correlation-based regularization (based on training data)

  # The convention in BERT is:
  # (a) For sequence pairs:
  #  tokens:   [CLS] is this jack ##son ##ville ? [SEP] no it is not . [SEP]
  #  type_ids: 0     0  0    0    0     0       0 0     1  1  1  1   1 1
  # (b) For single sequences:
  #  tokens:   [CLS] the dog is hairy . [SEP]
  #  type_ids: 0     0   0   0  0     0 0
  #
  # Where "type_ids" are used to indicate whether this is the first
  # sequence or the second sequence. The embedding vectors for `type=0` and
  # `type=1` were learned during pre-training and are added to the wordpiece
  # embedding vector (and position vector). This is not *strictly* necessary
  # since the [SEP] token unambiguously separates the sequences, but it makes
  # it easier for the model to learn the concept of sequences.
  #
  # For classification tasks, the first vector (corresponding to [CLS]) is
  # used as the "sentence vector". Note that this only makes sense because
  # the entire model is fine-tuned.
